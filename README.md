# jScript-Weathertop
JavaScript version of Weathertop application


Create a working version of an application for WeatherTop Inc, a web 
app where weather data can be logged and stored.


## Layout
The layout of the html for this project has been drawn largely from Fomantic UI. The build 
itself has been done using # play-template-1 from our web development labs.

## Creative Process
Each page has been designed with friendly UX in mind with a clear colour theme intended to give
a natural, authentic feeling when viewed.

I recycled my methods from Release 1 of WeatherTop and refactored them to suit the JavaScript language

I went with a US National Parks theme as having spent some time living in the USA and visiting some of these
parks I felt I could present a very enjoyable theme for the user of this app.

Of course WeatherTop is not constrained to be used only to track weather data in these areas, however
I feel in terms of selling this site having a cohesive theme bodes well in terms of a sense of professionalism.
